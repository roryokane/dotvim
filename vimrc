" TODO fix the sukima/xmledit plugin so that it loads properly in HTML
" Right now, auto-closing of HTML tags is only enabled in HTML mode after
"  previously opening XML mode. (It is always enabled in XML mode, as it
"  should be.)
" The insert-mode mapping for `>` to InsertGt (see it with `:imap >`) is
"  missing in HTML mode unless I open XML mode first.
" Add trace statements to the code to see if and when `html.vim` and `xml.vim`
"  are called when the filetype is set to html and to xml.
" The auto-closing does not happen in other filetypes, so whatever plugin it
"  is is tailored specifically for HTML and XML. It is just loading one of its
"  features wrong so that it is only activated when loading XML.
" See also :help 'runtimepath'
" Actually, even if I disable the single other plugin with a `filetypes/xml.vim`
"  or whatever, the problem still happens.
" I am debugging events using global variables g:ran_html_vim and g:ran_xml_vim,
"  inspecting their values when I just load HTML, just load XML, and load
"  XML followed by HTML.
" Look up Vim’s rules for loading ftplugin files
" look for related problems in https://github.com/sukima/xmledit/issues
" If I can’t get xmledit to work, I could use
"  https://github.com/docunext/closetag.vim. But I’m not sure if that’s a
"  better idea than just switching to XML mode when necessary.

" TODO wait for plugin 'henrik/vim-indexed-search' to actually work,

" I tested it by commenting out everything in my vimrc except the plugin, and
"  it still didn’t work. I guess it broke with some Vim update, and I should
"  just wait for the developers to fix it.
" After I install it and it works, I will need to fix it overwriting my custom
"  / and ? mappings. I can do that with this strategy:
"  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12770103/overriding-a-remapping-from-a-plugin#comment17258140_12770103
" That is, create a global variable `g:vim_indexed_search_map_forward_search`.
" Let it default to '/' if not set. If it is set, use `execute()` and
"  `get(g:, …)` to write the mapping with that variable contents.
" Have a similar mapping for backwards search, too. And maybe for n, N, *, and
"  #, to be thorough.
" Mapping contents could be like '/\V' (my current mapping; verynomagic search),
"  or like ':M/' (for users of the 'othree/eregex.vim' plugin)
" Instead of waiting for the plugin to be fixed, I have other options, too:
" http://stackoverflow.com/a/4671105/578288
"  write code to put the search index in the status line
" http://stackoverflow.com/a/4681402/578288
"  have a command or mapping that prints the number of instances of the search
" http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1682
"  see if the older, original plugin doesn’t work with newer Vim too

" TODO fix that when indenting with >> or <<, the cursor stays at the same column –
"  it should stay on the same character instead

" FIXME for all new NERDTree tree browsers, `setlocal sidescrolloff=1`
" this will prevent double-clicking on an entry from sometimes scrolling the
"  list horizontally
" I think I will have to edit or fork NERDTree to implement that; I don’t see
"  a general way with NERDTree’s current customization possibilities, and
"  there are too many entry points for me to do it just in my NERDTree-opening
"  mappings and autocommands. I could wrap `:NERDTree`, but that might be too
"  brittle – for example, is that called by `:NERDTreeToggle`?

" TODO set 'foldtext' so that folds look just like the first and last lines

" TODO try the gruvbox color scheme (https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox),
"  which has light/dark modes with the same colors like solarized, and which
"  uses many hues, but which uses a dark grey background for dark mode
"  instead of solarized's dark blue one that clashes with green text

" TODO Make the 'softtabstop' setting apply only to leading indentation, not
" to all whitespace in a line. I don't think a solution is built into Vim; I
" would have to find or write a plugin. The current behavior is annoying in,
" for example, files with sts=2 where I am writing text. If I accidentally
" type two spaces instead of one and then try to delete one, both are deleted,
" and I have to type the space again.

" TODO in the syntax highlighting, color the 'list' characters very close to
" the background. The theme “mac_classic” gets this right, but my main theme
" “solarized” doesn’t.

" TODO Make a function and a mapping to toggle dots ‘.’ and hyphens ‘-’ being
" included in 'iskeyword', for easier selection of the last element in a
" function call `foo.bar` in `…, foo.bar)`. (Toggling of a camel-case move
" mode would have to be from a separate feature/plugin, because though
" 'iskeyword' could toggle underscores, it can't represent word breaks just
" before capital letters.)
" Maybe a better solution would be a mapping that toggles the character under
" the cursor being in 'iskeyword'. It would be more flexible, but slower to
" use.
